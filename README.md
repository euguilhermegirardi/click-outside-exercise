# click-outside-exercise

## About the exercise

- The **click-outside-exercise** is an exercise built with **_VanillaJS_** only where you can click in a button and it will shows up a card in a model-outer with a model-innter inside of it .

## The functionality

It's pretty simple to understand. 
This exercise has 3 files, the index.html, index.js and the styles.css.
In the **index.html** I set all the basic informations.
In the **index.css** I hide the model-outer with opacity to show up only when the button is clicked.
And in the **index.js** I set all the functionalties that is needed. I grab the button, model-outer and model-inner. By clicking in the button you will populate the model-innter with all the necessary info to display the 'card'.
